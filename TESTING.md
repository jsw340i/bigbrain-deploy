# Testing Approach

## Overview
Component testing focuses on verifying individual components' behavior by simulating user interactions and checking their outputs. The goal is to ensure that each component behaves correctly in different scenarios.

## Tools
- **Vitest**: Testing framework.
- **@testing-library/react**: For simulating user interactions and rendering components.

## Key Principles
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on how the component behaves, not its internals.
- **Keep tests clear and concise**: Name tests descriptively and avoid complexity.
- **Cover edge cases**: Handle boundary conditions and error cases.
- **Mock dependencies**: Isolate components from external dependencies like APIs or state management.

# UI Testing Approach for Admin Happy Path

## Overview
UI testing for the admin happy path ensures that the application behaves as expected. This includes registering, creating a game, and handling game lifecycle operations like starting, ending, and viewing results.

## Tools
- **Cypress**: Testing framwork

## Steps to Test

1. **Register Successfully**: Admin should be able to register a new account and get redirected to the dashboard.
2. **Create a New Game**: Admin should be able to create a new game successfully.
3. **Start a Game**: Admin can start a game successfully.
4. **End a Game**: Admin can end a game, even if no one has played.
5. **Load Results Page**: Admin can load the results page after the game ends.
6. **Log Out**: Admin can log out of the application successfully.
7. **Log In Again**: Admin can log back into the application with valid credentials.

that is my overall thought process on how I will do my tests
