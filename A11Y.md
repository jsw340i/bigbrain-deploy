# Accessibility Improvements

In my application, I have made a few basic accessibility improvements to ensure that it is usable by as many people as possible. Below are some of the key accessibility features I have implemented.

## 1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - I have ensured that users can navigate through the application using just the keyboard. All interactive elements such as buttons and links can be accessed using the Tab key.

## 2. **Semantic HTML**
   - I have used proper HTML elements (such as `<button>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`) to structure the page in a way that is more understandable for screen readers. This helps users who rely on assistive technologies.

## 3. **Alt Text for Images**
   - All images in the application have appropriate alternative text (alt text) that describes the image's content. This helps visually impaired users understand what the image is about.

## 4. **Color Contrast**
   - I have made sure there is enough contrast between text and the background to make the content easier to read, particularly for users with vision impairments.

## 5. **Clear Button Labels**
   - Buttons and links are clearly labeled to indicate their purpose. For example, buttons that submit forms or navigate between pages have text that describes their action, making it easier for users to understand what each button does.

## 6. **Error Messages**
   - If users make a mistake when filling out a form, I provide simple error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it. This helps users understand and correct any issues they encounter.

## 7. **Focus Indicators**
   - Interactive elements (like buttons and links) have a clear focus state when they are selected with the keyboard. This helps keyboard users know which element they are currently interacting with.

These basic accessibility improvements are intended to make the application more inclusive and usable for a wider range of users.
